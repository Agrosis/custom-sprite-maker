tile -> image conversion
tiles are 8x8 pxels
4 bits per pixel


physical -> data conversion
[pointer region]
first get the count of all animations
allocate enough memory for all pointers
then getting the number of animations and
frames, you can also add the pointers to
animation data
[animation data]
Allocate enough memory for all the count of
frames. since animation type and delay is
known, append it during allocation. if the
sprite has 1 palette, also repoint all
palette pointers during allocation.
